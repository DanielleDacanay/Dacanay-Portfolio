    <p class="overview-summary">
      <strong>Problem: </strong>Many restaurants still rely on handwritten appointment books to manage reservations. This can be overwhelming and at times unreliable.
       <br>
       <br>
      <strong>Goal: </strong>design an app that streamlines reservation management tasks and allows users to easily add, update and find reservations.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Role: </strong>UX Researcher, UI Designer
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Responsibilities: </strong>Conduct interviews and usability studies, create wireframes and prototypes, test for accessibility and iterate on designs
<br>
<br>
    <strong>Duration: </strong> November 2021 - January 2022 (8 weeks)

<!--User Research-->
<section class="intro" id="intro">
  <h1>User Research</h1> <br>
  <p>In order to better understand the users and their needs, I conducted interviews and created empathy maps. A primary user group identified during the research was busy restaurant hosts who had more than one role on the staff. This user group confirmed some initial assumptions about restaurant hosts, but further research revealed that time constraints were only part of the causes for finding difficulty with bookkeeping. Other challenges included inconsistency and legibility.</p>

  <p>Two rounds of usability studies were conducted – one moderated and one unmoderated. Findings from the first study helped uncover major pain points with the initial design. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what elements still needed refinement.</p>
