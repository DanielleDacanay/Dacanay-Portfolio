    <p class="overview-summary">
      <strong>Problem: </strong>Many restaurants still rely on handwritten appointment books to manage reservations. This can be overwhelming and at times unreliable.
       <br>
       <br>
      <strong>Goal: </strong>design an app that streamlines reservation management tasks and allows users to easily add, update and find reservations.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Role: </strong>UX Researcher, UI Designer
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Responsibilities: </strong>Conduct interviews and usability studies, create wireframes and prototypes, test for accessibility and iterate on designs
<br>

    <strong>Duration: </strong> November 2021 - January 2022 (8 weeks)

<!--User Research-->
<section class="intro" id="intro">
  <h1>User Research</h1> <br>
  <p>In order to better understand the users and their needs, I conducted interviews and created empathy maps. A primary user group identified during the research was busy restaurant hosts who had more than one role on the staff. This user group confirmed some initial assumptions about restaurant hosts, but further research revealed that time constraints were only part of the causes for finding difficulty with bookkeeping. Other challenges included inconsistency and legibility.</p>

    <h2>Paper Wireframes</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When iterating on the home screen, I prioritized ease of access and minimalistic design to allow for easy navigation. When choosing the elements to include in the refined version, I opted for elements that were easy to understand and gave quick access to the most-used features.</p>

<!--Usability Findings-->
<section class="intro" id="intro">
  <h1>Usability Findings</h1> <br>
  <p>Two rounds of usability studies were conducted – one moderated and one unmoderated. Findings from the first study helped uncover major pain points with the initial design. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what elements still needed refinement.</p>
</section>
<div class="gallery">
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Round 1 Findings</h2>
    <li>Users wanted to filter information</li>
    <li>Users wanted a less cluttered calendar design</li>
    <li>Users wanted an edit option</li>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Round 2 Findings</h2>
    <li>Users were confused by the “Guest Book” label</li>
    <li>Users wanted a way to know which guests had arrived or had been seated</li>
  </div>
</div>
<section class="intro" id="intro">
  <h1>Refining the design</h1> <br>
</section>
<div class="gallery">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="assets/images/bookd_mockup1.png" class="gallery-img">
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <h2>Clutter-free</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Usability studies revealed that users found it troublesome to scroll horizontally and vertically to see the rest of the reservations placed for the same time slot. I revised the design so that only <strong>vertical scrolling</strong> was only necessary to see future reservations. I also added a <strong>filter</strong> option for users who found the calendar overwhelming.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="assets/images/bookd_mockup2.png" class="gallery-img">
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <h2>Proximity</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The second usability study showed that users filled out information more quickly when the guest’s personal information was grouped together while the reservation information followed after.</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The second usability study revealed that users responded better and had more positive first impressions with a more streamlined color palette. The darker call-to-action buttons also made it easier for some users to read text.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!--High-fidelity Protoype-->
<section class="intro" id="intro">
  <h1>High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The high-fidelity prototype showcases a more streamlined user flow with a more modern and less distracting design. It prioritizes the user need for quick actions.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As I was designing this app, I learned that my interpretation of what a good and useful design is does not necessarily mean that it is the best design for what users need. The end-users’ perceptions are ultimately the most reliable deciding factors for app design.</p>
